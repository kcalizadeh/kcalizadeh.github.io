							<span id="intro"><h2>Introducing the Philosophy Data Project!</h2></span>
							<hr />
							<p>
								This website started as a capstone project for a data science bootcamp at Flatiron School. But then I thought to myself that maybe
								other people might like to explore the history of philosophy with the tools I had developed. So I figured why not make them all available in 
								a single, public, and easy-to-use location? The Philosophy Data Project is the result: a website for easy, accessible, and data-driven exploration of philosophical texts.
								<br>
								<span id='why'><h3>Why Study Philosophy?</h3></span>
								Of course, one big question is why we should even take the time to study these philosophical texts. If you're here, you may already be a philosopher or have some background in philosophy, 
								so maybe you don't need any convincing - after all, knowledge is good for its own sake, isn't it? 
								<br><br>
								But if you're wondering how valuable a study of philosophical texts could be for anyone who isn't already interested in the topic, the answer is: very valuable. To see why, ask yourself a couple questions.
								Do you think human beings are intrinsically good and generous or intrinsically evil and selfish? Do you think that logic and reason should make all our decisions, or should our emotions be our primary guides? Do you think that science
								can answer all the questions there are about the world, or are there issues fundamentally beyond its reach? Do you think economic competition makes products and people better, or does it only lead to oppression?
								<br><br>
								In answering these questions, you're describing your own personal philosophy. And it's easy to see that your answers to these questions say a lot about you. The thinkers in our dataset represent a vast array
								of different answers to these kinds of questions. Based on their works, we can build data analysis tools to help understand the core beliefs of people in the modern era. 
								<br><br>
								If you've followed me this far,
								then I'm sure you can see that the applications are endless. We can use this data to help people understand themselves and recommend readings that would enrich their quality of life, as in Logic-Based Therapy. 
								We can use it to facilitate cross-cultural connections by helping people respect each others' core beliefs. We could use it to identify dangerous ideologies and counteract terrorism.
								We can use it to understand our clients, customers, and employees, crafting products and work environments that suit them and help them flourish. The list goes on and on.
								<br><br>
								I'll conclude this section with a comparison to another field of NLP that has already proven it's value: sentiment analysis. Where sentiment analysis tries to understand how people <i>feel</i> about specific products or 
								ideas, this project aims to understand how people <i>think</i> about each other and the world around them. Instead of sentiment analysis, what we're doing here is ideological analysis.
								<br><br>
								<h3>The Data</h3>
								There are so many different philosophers to choose from, but we had to start somewhere. Our initial dataset contains 51 philosophical texts spanning 10 core schools of philosophy.
								<br><br>
								The schools included in the corpus are:
								<div class="row">
									<div class="column">
										<li>Plato</li>
										<li>Aristotle</li>
										<li>Rationalism </li>
										<li>Empiricism</li>
										<li>German Idealism</li>
									</div>
									<div class="column">
										<li>Communism</li>
										<li>Capitalism</li>
										<li>Phenomenology</li>
										<li>Continental Philosophy</li>
										<li>Analytic Philosophy</li>
									</div>
								  </div>
								<br>
								The schools were chosen to give a broad overview of different ideas about the world and to represent more or less the full history of philosophy (nevermind the 1500 years between Aristotle and Descartes, those 
								ages are called dark for a reason). 
								<br><br>
								<h3>Site Features</h3>
								This site has 4 primary features: a <a href='classifier.html'>classifier</a>, a tool for <a href='w2v.html'>word use analysis</a>, <a href='stats.html'>basic stats</a> on each source,
								and a tool for <a href='search.html'>searching the dataset</a>. Since some of these can be difficult to interpret to those not familiar with the techniques of data science, I've provided a 
								page describing how to <a href='interpret.html'>interpret the results</a> of the different site features.
								<br><br>
								Each of these can be used either for business purposes (to classify texts and then research the relevant schools) or just for education or entertainment. I encourage you 
								mess around with them - classify your favorite song lyrics, see how different philosophers think of love, compare who writes the longest sentences. Have fun!
								<br><br>
								<h3>Future Additions</h3>
								While the site as it stands has a lot of useful tools, this project is far from finished. The nd goal is to include a far greater number of texts in the corpus so that the site can 
								be helpful to everyone, not just people interested in the major figures of the western canon. There are also a number of additional data analysis features that are still in the works. 
								Overall, the key future additions fall into two major categories.
								<br><br>
								<b>1. Expanding The Corpus</b><br>
								Under this heading, the following thinkers and schools are top priorities:
								<div class="row">
									<div class="column3">
										<li>Stoicism</li>
										<li>Scholasticism</li>
										<li>Pre-Socratics</li>
									</div>
									<div class="column3">
										<li>Daoism</li>
										<li>Confucianism</li>
										<li>Buddhist texts</li>
									</div>
									<div class='column3'>
										<li>Feminism</li>
										<li>Race Theory</li>
										<li>Gender Studies</li>
									</div>
								</div>
								<br>
								While these the top priorities right now, if you have any suggestions or texts you'd like to contribute, feel free to <a href='mailto:kcalizadeh@gmail.com'>contact me</a> and I'll do our best to get them added.
								<br><br>
								<b>2. Adding Additional Features</b><br>
								I'd also like to add a number of features for public use. One of these would be a web-scraper that could discovery secondary sources. We could then use the tools we've already developed to analyze the secondary literature, both in its own 
								right and in comparison to the primary sources. A second project for future development is a more detailed Twitter interface that could go beyond merely classifying philosophers and could track trends in ideology over time, perhaps within
								certain subgroups of the site. Last and perhaps most simply, it would be great to include date information in the corpus so that word use and word similarity could be tracked over time. This would be an interesting way to analyze the history of philosophy
								and track cultural and conceptual trends.
								<br><br>
								To be honest, these are just the tip of the iceberg, and the potential for developing more and greater tools is enormous. If you'd like to <a href='support.html'>get involved</a>, please don't hesitate to reach out. But for now, stay tuned for more developments and enjoy the site!
