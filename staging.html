                            <br>
                            <p><b>Aristotle</b> was born around 384 B.C.E in the Greek kingdom of Macedonia, where his father was the royal doctor. He grew up to be most influential philosopher ever 
                                and was given nicknames like <b>The Master</b> and <b>The Philosopher</b>. Oh - forgot to mention he was also the tutor of <b>Alexander The Great</b>. There are 
                                at least 4 great questions which Aristotle has discussed:</p>
                                
                                <b>What makes people Happy ?</b>
                                <p>According to Aristotle a person his happy if he/she posses the following virtues: Courage, Temperance, Liberality, Magnificence, Pride, Patience, Truthfulness, Witiness, Friendliness, Modesty.</p>
                                <b>What is Art For?</b>
                                <p>Aristotle created a manual for writing great plays named <i>The Poetics</i>. He has introduced the ideas of <i>peripeteia</i> or sudden change in fortune and <i>anagnoresis</i> or a sudden moment 
                                    of dramatic revelation. By these literary devices Aristorle wants to bring home the notion that tragedy can befall on anyone, and in such moments we must be kind and compasenate toward others.</p>
                                <b>What are Friends for ?</b>
                                <p>According to Aristotle there are 3 kinds of friendships: The one where each individual is seeking fun or him/herself. The one where everyone wants a strategic advantage from one another. 
                                The one which is True Friendship, where each person helps the other be a better version of themselves.</p>
                                <b>How can ideas cut through a Busy World ?</b>
                                <p>Like most of us, Aristotle also wondered why the best idea does not always wins the argument. He studied his surroundings and came up with the art of Rhetoric where he emphasied
                                     the ideas of making a discussion funny (because people has short attention spans), being empathetic toward other people.</p>

                                it is possible that a should belong neither to any nor to any and that should not belong to any eg a genus to species of another genus for animal belongs neither to music nor to medicine nor does music belong to the medicine if then it is assumed that a belongs to no and to every the conclusion will be true and if is not wholly false but in part only even so that conclusion may be true for nothing prevents a belonging to the whole of and of while belongs to some eg a genus to its species and difference for animal belongs to every man and to every footed thing and man to some footed things though not to all if then it is assumed that a belongs to every and to every a will belong to every c and this ex hypothesi is true for it is possible that a should neither belong to any nor to any though belongs to some eg a genus to the species of another genus and its difference for animalneither belongs to any wisdom nor to any speculative science but wisdom belongs to some speculative sciences if then it should be assumed that a belongs to no and to every a will belong to no c and this ex hypothesi is true in particular deductions it is possible when the first proposition is wholly false and the other true that the conclusion should be true also when the first is false in part and the other true and when the first is true and the particular is false and when both are false for nothing prevents a belonging to no but to some and to some eg animal belongs to no snow but to some white thing and snow to some white thing if then snow is taken as middle and animal as first term and it is assumed that a belongs to the whole of and to some then is wholly false true and the conclusion true similarly if the proposition is negative for it is possible that a should belong to the whole of but not to some although belongs to some eg animal belongs to every man but does not follow some white but man belongs to some white consequently if man be taken as middle term andsee if the term rendered fails to be a property of the affirmation for if it is not a property of the affirmation it will be a property of the negation this commonplace rule is however false for an affirmation is not a property of a negation or a negation of an affirmation for an affirmation does not belong at all to a negation while a negation though it belongs to an affirmation does not belong as a property next look from the point of view of the co ordinate members of a division and see for destructive purposes if none of the one set of co ordinate members is a property of any of the remaining set of co ordinate members for then neither will the term stated be a property of that of which it is stated to be a property thus e g inasmuch as perceptible living being is not a property of any of the other living beings intelligible living being will not be a property of god for constructive purposes on the other hand see if some one or other of the remaining co ordinate members is a property of each of these co ordinate members for then the remaining one too will be a property of that of which it has been stated not to be a property thus e g inasmuch as it is a property of prudence to be essentially the natural virtue of the rational faculty and so too taking each of the other virtues in this way it will be a property of temperance to be essentially the natural virtue of the faculty of desire next look from the point of view of the inflexions and see for destructive purposes if the inflexion fails to be a property of the inflexion for then neither will the other inflexion be a property of the other inflexion thus e g inasmuch as beautifully is not a property of justly neither will beautiful be a property of just for constructive purposes on the other hand see if the inflexion is a property reading tesphaseos idion ei gar metes phaseos idion eie of the inflexion for then also the other inflexion will be a property of the other inflexion thus e g inasmuch as being terrestrial and two footed is a property of man it will be a property of to a man to be described as to a terrestrial and two footed thing not only in the case of the actual term mentioned should one look at the inflexions but also in the case of its opposites as we said in the case of the former commonplace rules as well thus for destructive purposes see if the inflexion of the opposite fails to be the property of the inflexion of the opposite for then neither will the inflexion of the other opposite be a property of the inflexion of the other opposite thus e g inasmuch as well is not a property of justly neither will badly be a property of unjustly for constructive purposes on the other handthe proof will follow the same course as for the universal deductions and the same terms may be used it is clear then in this figure also when and how a deduction can be formed and when the conclusion is possible and when it is simple it is evident also that all deductions in this figure are imperfect and that they are made perfect by means of the first figure it is clear from what has been said that the deductions in these figures are made perfect by means of the universal deductions in the first figure and are reduced to them that every deduction without qualification can be so treated will be clear presently when it has been proved that every deduction is formed through one or other of these figures it is necessary that every demonstration and every deduction should prove either that something belongs or that it does not and this either universally or in part and further either probatively or hypothetically one sort of hypothetical proof is the reductio ad impossibile let us speak first of probative deductions for after it has been proved in their case the truth of our contention will be clear with regard to those which are proved per impossibile and in general hypothetically if then one wants to deduce that a belongs or does not belong to one must assume something of something if now a should be assumed of the proposition originally in question will have been assumed but if a should be assumed of but should not be assumed of anything nor anything of it nor anything else of no deduction will be possible for nothing necessarily follows from the assumption of some one thing concerning some one thing thus we must take another proposition as well if then a be assumed of something else or something else of or something different of nothing prevents a deduction being formed but it will not be in relation to through the propositions taken nor when belongs to something else and that to something elseand so on no connexion however being made with will a deduction be possible in relation to for in generalonly one provided that this is not either of the premisses indifferently but the second if it is taken as wholly false but if it is not taken as wholly false it does not matter which of the two is false let a belong to the whole of but to no neither let belong to this is possible eg animal belongs to no stone nor stone to any man if then a is taken to belong to every and to every a will belong to every c consequently though both the see the conclusion is true for every man is an animal similarly with the negative for it is possible that neither a nor should belong to any although a belongs to every eg if the same terms are taken and man is put as middle for neither animal nor man belongs to any stone but animal belongs to every man consequently if one term is taken to belong to none of that to which it does belong and the other term is taken to belong to all of that to which it does not belong though both the premisses are false the conclusion will be true a similar proof may be given if each premiss is partially false but if one only of the premisses is false when the first premiss is wholly false ie the conclusion will not be true but if is wholly false a true conclusion will be possible i mean by wholly false the contrary of the truth eg if what belongs to none is assumed to belong to all or if what belongs to all is assumed to belong to noneif the negative is transposed the proof can be made by means of the same terms it is clear also that the same holds for particular deductions for nothing prevents a belonging to every and to some though does not belong to some eg animal to every man and to some white things though man will not belong to some white things if then it is stated that a belongs to no and to some the universal proposition is wholly false the particular is true and the conclusion is true similarly if is affirmative for it is possible that a should belong to no and not to some though does not belong to some eg animal belongs to nothing inanimate and to some white things and inanimate will not belong to some white things if then it is stated that a belongs to and not to some the which is universal is wholly false is true and the conclusion is true also a true conclusion is possible when the universal is true and the particular is false for nothing prevents a following neither nor at all while does not belong to some eg animal belongs to no number nor to anything inanimate and number does not follow some inanimate things if then it is stated that a belongs to no and to some the conclusion will be true and the universal proposition true but the particular false similarly if the premiss which is stated universally affirmative for it is possible that a should belong both to and to as wholes though does not follow some eg a genus in relation to its species and difference for animalfollows every man and footed things as a whole but man does not follow every footed thing consequently if it is assumed that a belongs to the whole of but does not belong to some the universal propositionis if anyone were to postulate in particular cases what he has undertaken to prove universally eg if he undertook to show that the knowledge of contraries is always one and postulated it of certain pairs of contraries for he seems to be postulating independently and by itself what together with a number of other things he ought to have proved again if he divides up the problem and postulates its parts supposing eg that he had to prove that medicine is a science of what leads to health and to disease and were to claim first the one then the other or if he postulates the one or the other of a pair of statements that necessarily follow one other e g if he had to prove that the diagonal is incommensurable with the side and were to postulate that the side is incommensurable with the diagonal the ways in which people assume contraries are equal in number to those in which they postulate the point at issue for it would happen firstly if any one were to postulate opposites affirmation and negation secondly if he were to postulate the contrary terms of an antithesis eg that the same thing is good and evil thirdly suppose anyone were to claim something universally and then proceed to postulate its contradictory in some particular case eg if having assumed that the knowledge of contraries is one he were to claim that the knowledge of what makes for health or for disease is different or suppose him after postulating the latter view to try to secure universally the contradictory statement again suppose a man postulates the contrary of what necessarily comes about through the premisses laid down even without postulating the opposites themselves but postulating two premisses such that the opposite contradiction will follow from them the securing of contraries differs from postulating the point at issue in this way in the latter case the mistake lies in regard to the conclusion for it is looking see prior analytics at the conclusion that we say that the point at issue has been postulated whereas contrary views lie in the propositions viz in a certain relation which they bear to one another the best way to secure training and practice in arguments of this kind is in the first place to get into the habit of converting the arguments for in this way we shall be better equipped for dealing with the proposition stated and from a few cases we shall know thoroughly several arguments for conversion is taking the reverse of the conclusion together with the remaining propositions asked and so demolishing one of those that were conceded for it follows necessarily that if the conclusion is untrue some one of the propositions is demolished seeing that given all of them the conclusion was bound to follow in dealing with any thesis be on the look out for a line of argument both pro and con and on discovering it at once set about looking for the solution of it for in this way you will soon find that you have trained yourself at the same time in both asking questions and answering them if we cannot find any one else to argue with we should argue with ourselves select moreover arguments relating to the same thesis and range them side by side for this produces a plentiful supply of arguments for carrying a point by force and in refutationis to put it to active use moreover examine the case of terms that are opposed as privation and possession for if the one term is used in more than one way then so will the remaining term eg if to perceive is used in more than one way as applied to the soul and to the body then to be imperceptive too will be used in more than one way as applied to the soul and to the body that the opposition between the terms now in question depends upon privation and possession is clear since animals naturally possess each kind of perception both as applied to the soul and as applied to the body moreover examine the inflected forms for if justly is used in more than one way the just also will be used in more than one way for there will be a just corresponding to each justly eg if justly is used of judging according i to one s own opinion and also of judging as one ought then just also will be used in like manner in the same way also if healthy is used in more than one way then healthily also will be used in more than one way eg if healthy is what produces health and what preserves health and what betokens health then healthily also will be used to mean in such a way as to produce or preserve or betoken health likewise also in other cases whenever the original term is used in more than one way the inflexion also that is formed from it will be used in more than one way and vice versa look also at the classes of the predicates signified by the term and see if they are the same in all cases for if they are not the same then clearly the term is homonymous eg good in the case of food</p>

                                <p><b>George Berkeley</b> (12 March 1685 – 14 January 1753) – known as Bishop Berkeley (Bishop of Cloyne of the Anglican Church of Ireland) – was an Anglo-Irish philosopher whose primary achievement was the advancement of a theory he called "immaterialism" (later referred to as "subjective idealism" by others). This theory denies the existence of material substance and instead contends that familiar objects like tables and chairs are ideas perceived by the minds and, as a result, cannot exist without being perceived. 
                                    Berkeley is also known for his critique of abstraction, an important premise in his argument for immaterialism</p>

                                            Summary as follows: <br> 
                                            <br>
                                            an object extended coloured and moved this mixed or compound idea the mind resolving into its simple constituent parts and viewing each by itself exclusive of the rest does frame the abstract ideas of extension colour and motion not that it is possible for colour or motion to exist without extension but only that the mind can frame to itself by the idea of colour exclusive of extension and of motion exclusive of both colour and extension again the mind having observed that in the particular extensions perceived by sense there is something and alike and some other things peculiar as this or that figure or magnitude which distinguish them one from another it considers apart or singles out by itself that which is common making thereof a most abstract idea of extension which is neither line surface nor solid nor has any figure or magnitude but is an idea entirely prescinded from all these so likewise the mind by leaving out of the particular colours perceived by sense that which distinguishes them one from another and retaining that only which is makes an idea of colour in abstract which is neither red nor blue nor white nor any other determinate colour and in like manner by considering motion abstractedly not only from the body moved but likewise from the figure it describes and all particular directions and velocities the abstract idea of motion is framed which equally corresponds to all particular motions whatsoever that may be perceived by sense vide reid on the intellectual powers of man essay chap sec and as the mind frames to itself abstract ideas of qualities or so does it by the same precision or mental separation attain abstract ideas of the more compounded which include several coexistent qualities for example the mind having observed that peter james and john resemble each other in certain common agreements of shape and other qualities leaves out of the complex or compounded idea it has of peter james and any other particular man that which is peculiar to each retaining only what is common to allbut i shall explain my meaning a human spirit or person is not perceived by sense as not being an idea when therefore we see the colour size figure and motions of a man we perceive only certain sensations or ideas excited in our own minds and these being exhibited to our view in sundry distinct collections serve to mark out unto us the existence of finite and created spirits like ourselves hence it is plain we do not see a man if by man is meant that which lives moves perceives and thinks as we do but only such a certain collection of ideas as directs us to think there is a distinct principle of thought and motion like to ourselves accompanying and represented by it and after the same manner we see god all the difference is that whereas some one finite and narrow assemblage of ideas denotes a particular human mind whithersoever we direct our view we do at all times and in all places perceive manifest tokens of the divinity everything we see hear feel or anywise perceive by sense being a sign or effect of the power of god as is our perception of those very motions which are produced by men it is therefore plain that nothing can be more evident to any one that is capable of the least reflexion than the existence of god or a spirit who is intimately present to our minds producing in them all that variety of ideas or sensations which continually affect us on whom we have an absolute and entire dependence in short in whom we live and move and have our being that the discovery of this great truth which lies so near and obvious to the mind should be attained to by the reason of so very few is a sad instance of the stupidity and inattention of men who though they are surrounded with such clear manifestations of the deity are yet so little affected by them that they seem as it were blinded with excess of light butthey be variously combined together and to the end their use be permanent and universal these combinations must be made by rule and with wise contrivance by this means abundance of information is conveyed unto us concerning what we are to expect from such and such actions and what methods are proper to be taken for the exciting such and such ideas which in effect is all that i conceive to be distinctly meant when it is said that by discerning a figure texture and mechanism of the inward parts of bodies whether natural or artificial we may attain to know the several uses and properties depending thereon or the nature of the thing hence it is evident that those things which under the notion of a cause co operating or concurring to the production of effects are altogether inexplicable and run us into great absurdities may be very naturally explained and have a proper and obvious use assigned to them when they are considered only as marks or signs for our information and it is the searching after and endeavouring to understand those signs instituted by the author of nature that ought to be the employment of the natural philosopher and not the pretending to explain things by corporeal causes which doctrine seems to have too much estranged the minds of men from that active principle that supreme and wise spirit in whom we live move and have our being in the twelfth place it may perhaps be objected that though it be clear from what has been said that there can be no such thing as an inert senseless extended solid figured movable substance existing without the mind such as philosophers describe matter yet if any man shall leave out of his idea of matter the positive ideas of extension figure solidity and motion and say that he means only by that word</p>

                                <p><b>Gilles Deleuze</b> (18 January 1925 – 4 November 1995) was a French philosopher who, from the early 1950s until his death in 1995, wrote on philosophy, literature, film, and fine art. His most popular works were the two volumes of Capitalism and Schizophrenia: Anti-Oedipus (1972) and A Thousand Plateaus (1980), both co-written with psychoanalyst Félix Guattari. His metaphysical treatise Difference and Repetition (1968) is considered by many scholars to be his magnum opus. An important part of Deleuze's oeuvre is devoted to the reading of other philosophers: the Stoics, Leibniz, Hume, Kant, Nietzsche, and Bergson, with particular influence derived from Spinoza.A. W. Moore, citing Bernard Williams's criteria for a great thinker, ranks Deleuze among the "greatest philosophers". Although he once characterized himself as a "pure metaphysician",[16] his work has influenced a variety of disciplines across the humanities, including philosophy, art, and literary theory, as well as movements such as post-structuralism and postmodernism.</p>

                                            the concept of difference was thereby confused with a simply conceptual difference and difference was thereby understood within identity since the concept in general was only the manner in which the principle of identity was deployed within representation repetition for its part could no longer be defined as other than a difference without concept this definition obviously continued to presuppose the identity of the concept for that which was repeated but instead of inscribing the difference within the concept it placed it outside the concept in the form of a numerical difference and placed the concept itself outside itself as existing in as many exemplars as there were numerically distinct cases or times it thereby invoked an external force a form of exteriority capable of putting difference outside the identical concept and the identical concept outside itself by blocking its specification in the same way as an internal force or form of inferiority capable of putting difference into the concept and the concept into itself by means of a continued specification was invoked earlier it was therefore at the same time and from the same point of view that the supposed identity of the concept integrated and internalised difference in the form of conceptual difference while on the contrary projecting repetition as a correlative difference but without concept and explained negatively or by default however if everything is related in this chain of confusions so must everything be related in the rectification of difference and repetition ideas are not concepts they are a form of eternally positive differential multiplicity distinguished from the identity of concepts instead of representing difference by subordinating it to the identity of concepts and thereby to the resemblance of perception the opposition of predicates and the analogy of judgement they liberate it and cause it to evolve in positive systems in which different is related to different making divergence disparity and decentring so many objects of affirmation which rupture the framework of conceptual representation the powers of repetition include displacement and disguise just as difference includes power of divergence and decentring the one no less than the other belongs to ideas for ideasno morethe two repetitions enter into so many different relations that it would require an extremely systematic clinical study of a kind yet to be undertaken in order to distinguish the cases which correspond to their possible combinations consider the gestural or linguistic repetitions and iterations or stereotypical behaviours associated with dementia and schizophrenia these no longer seem to manifest a will capable of investing an object within the context of a ceremony rather they function like reflexes which indicate a general breakdown of investment whence the impossibility for patients to repeat at will in the tests to which they are subjected it is nevertheless the case that involuntary repetition depends not upon aphasic or amnesiac difficulties as a negative explanation would suggest but on subcortical lesions and thymic disorders is this another way of explaining repetition negatively as though the patient reverted through degeneration to primitive non integrated circuits in fact in cases of iterations and even of stereotypes we should note the constant presence of contractions which show up at least in parasitic vowels or consonants contraction continues to have two aspects one by which it bears upon a physical element of repetition which it modifies the other by which it concerns a psychic totality which is repeatable in different degrees in this sense we can recognise a persistent intentionality in every stereotype even in a schizophrenic grinding of the jaws this intentionality amounts to investing the entire psychic life in a fragment gesture or word in the absence of any other object of investment these in turn becoming the elements of the other repetition for example the patient who turns ever more rapidly on one foot the other leg extended in such a way as to repel any person approaching from behind thereby miming his horror of women and his fear of being surprised by them the properly pathological aspect lies in the fact that on the one hand the contraction no longer ensures a resonance between two or more levels simultaneously playable in differenciated manners but rather crushes them all and compresses them into the stereotypical fragment on the other hand contraction no longer draws from the element a difference or modification which would permit repetition within a space and time organised by the will on the contrary it makes the modification itself the element to be repeated taking itself as object in an acceleration which precisely renders impossible any bare repetition of elements thus in these cases of iteration and stereotype we see not an independence of purely mechanical repetition but rather a specific difficulty in the relation between the two repetitions and in the process by which one is and remains the cause of the other repetition is the power of language and far from being explicable in negative fashion by some default on the part of nominal concepts it implies an always excessive idea of poetry the coexistent levels of a psychic totality may be considered to be actualised in differenciated series according to the singularities which characterise them these series are liable to resonate under the influence of a fragment or dark precursor which stands for this totality in which all the levels coexist each series is therefore repeated in the other at the same time as the precursor is displaced from one level to another and disguised in all the series it therefore does not belong to any level or degree in the case of verbal series we call a word which designates the sense of a preceding word a word of higher degree however the linguistic precursor the esoteric or poetic word par excellence objecthow then are we to avoid this profound repetition being hidden by the bare repetitions that it inspires and succumbing to the illusion of a primacy of brute repetition in the same movement the ground falls back into the representation of what it grounds while the circles begin to turn in the manner of the same for this reason it always seemed to us that the circles were unravelled in a third synthesis where the ground was abolished in a groundlessness the ideas were separated from the forms of memory and the displacement and disguise of repetition engaged divergence and decentring the powers of difference beyond the cycles the at first straight line of the empty form of time beyond memory the death instinct beyond resonance forced movement beyond bare repetition and clothed repetition beyond that from which difference is drawn and that which includes it a repetition which makes the difference beyond the grounded and grounding repetitions a repetition of ungrounding on which depend both that which enchains and that which liberates that which dies and that which lives within repetition beyond physical repetition and psychic or metaphysical repetition an ontological repetition the role of the latter would not be to suppress the other two but on the one hand to distribute difference to them in the form of difference drawn off or included and on the other hand to produce the illusion by which they are affected while nevertheless preventing them from developing the related error into which they fall in a certain sense the ultimate repetition the ultimate theatre therefore encompasses everything while in another sense it destroys everything and in yet another sense selects among everything perhaps the highest object of art is to bring into play simultaneously all these repetitions with their differences in kind and rhythm their respective displacements and disguises their divergences and decentrings to embed them in one another and to envelop one or the other in illusions the effect of which varies in each case art does not imitate above all because it repeats it repeatsthe right direction this condition grounds prediction itself it has often been noticed that if initially indistinguishable temperatures are allowed to differenciate it cannot be predicted which will increase or decrease and if viscosity is accelerated it will tear moving bodies from their state of rest but in an unpredictable direction well known pages by boltzmann comment upon this scientific and thermodynamic guarantee of good sense they show how within a partial system difference the improbable and the past are identified on the one hand while uniformity the probable and the future are identified on the other in the dream of a truly universal good sense one which attaches the feeling of the absolute to partial truths along with the moon to the earth this equalisation and homogenisation do not occur only in each partial system but continue from one system to another however as boltzmann shows this attachment is not legitimate any more than this synthesis of time is sufficient we are at least in a position to clarify the relation between good sense and common sense common sense was defined subjectively by the supposed identity of a self which provided the unity and ground of all the faculties and objectively by the identity of whatever object served as a focus for all the faculties this double identity however remains static we no more find ourselves before a universal indeterminate object than we are a universal self objects are divided up in and by fields of individuation as are selves common sense must therefore point beyond itself towards another dynamic instance capable of determining the indeterminate object as this or that and of individualising the self situated in this ensemble of objects this other instance is good sense which takes its point of departure from a difference at the origin of individuation however precisely because it ensures the distribution of that difference in such a manner that it tends to be cancelled in the object and because it provides a rule according to which the different objects tend to equalise themselves and the different selves tend to become uniform good sense in turn points towards the instance of a common sense which provides it with both the form of a universal self and that of an indeterminate object good sense therefore has two definitions one objective and one subjective which correspond to those of common sense a rule of universal distribution andthe second illusion already prepared us for this discovery of a mystification on the part of the negative it is in quality and extensity that intensity is inverted and appears upside down and its power of affirming difference is betrayed by the figures of quantitative and qualitative limitation qualitative and quantitative opposition limitation and opposition are first and second dimension surface effects whereas the living depths the diagonal is populated by differences without negation beneath the platitude of the negative lies the world of disparateness the origin of the illusion which subjects difference to the false power of the negative must therefore be sought not in the sensible world itself but in that which acts in depth and is incarnated in the sensible world we have seen that ideas are genuine objectivities made up of differential elements and relations and provided with a specific mode namely the problematic problems thus defined do not designate any ignorance on the part of a thinking subject any more than they express a conflict but rather objectively characterise the nature of ideas as such there is indeed therefore a me on which must not be confused with the ouk on and which means the being of the problematic and not the being of the negative an expletive rather than a negative not this me on is so called because it precedes all affirmation but is none the less completely positive problems ideas are positive multiplicities full and differentiated positivities described by the process of complete and reciprocal determination which relates problems to their conditions the positivity of problems is constituted by the fact of being posited thereby being related to their conditions and fully determined it is true that from this point of view problems give rise to propositions which give effect to them in the form of answers or cases of solution these propositions in turn represent affirmations the objects of which are those differences which correspond to the relations and the singularities of the differential field in this sense we can establish a distinction between the positive and the affirmative in other words between the positivity of ideas understood as differential positings and the affirmations to which they give rise which incarnate and solve them with regard to the latter we should say not only that they are different affirmations but that they are affirmations of differences as a consequence of the multiplicity which belongs to each idea affirmation understood as the affirmation of difference is produced by the positivity of problems understood as differential positings multiple affirmation is produced by problematic multiplicity it is of the essence of affirmation to be in itself multiple and to affirm difference as for the negative

							<span id="intro"><h2>Introducing the Philosophy Data Project!</h2></span>
							<hr />
							<p>
								This website started as a capstone project for a data science bootcamp at Flatiron School. But then I thought to myself that maybe
								other people might like to explore the history of philosophy with the tools I had developed. So I figured why not make them all available in 
								a single, public, and easy-to-use location? The Philosophy Data Project is the result: a website for easy, accessible, and data-driven exploration of philosophical texts.
								<br>
								<span id='why'><h3>Why Study Philosophy?</h3></span>
								Of course, one big question is why we should even take the time to study these philosophical texts. If you're here, you may already be a philosopher or have some background in philosophy, 
								so maybe you don't need any convincing - after all, knowledge is good for its own sake, isn't it? 
								<br><br>
								But if you're wondering how valuable a study of philosophical texts could be for anyone who isn't already interested in the topic, the answer is: very valuable. To see why, ask yourself a couple questions.
								Do you think human beings are intrinsically good and generous or intrinsically evil and selfish? Do you think that logic and reason should make all our decisions, or should our emotions be our primary guides? Do you think that science
								can answer all the questions there are about the world, or are there issues fundamentally beyond its reach? Do you think economic competition makes products and people better, or does it only lead to oppression?
								<br><br>
								In answering these questions, you're describing your own personal philosophy. And it's easy to see that your answers to these questions say a lot about you. The thinkers in our dataset represent a vast array
								of different answers to these kinds of questions. Based on their works, we can build data analysis tools to help understand the core beliefs of people in the modern era. 
								<br><br>
								If you've followed me this far,
								then I'm sure you can see that the applications are endless. We can use this data to help people understand themselves and recommend readings that would enrich their quality of life, as in Logic-Based Therapy. 
								We can use it to facilitate cross-cultural connections by helping people respect each others' core beliefs. We could use it to identify dangerous ideologies and counteract terrorism.
								We can use it to understand our clients, customers, and employees, crafting products and work environments that suit them and help them flourish. The list goes on and on.
								<br><br>
								I'll conclude this section with a comparison to another field of NLP that has already proven it's value: sentiment analysis. Where sentiment analysis tries to understand how people <i>feel</i> about specific products or 
								ideas, this project aims to understand how people <i>think</i> about each other and the world around them. Instead of sentiment analysis, what we're doing here is ideological analysis.
								<br><br>
								<h3>The Data</h3>
								There are so many different philosophers to choose from, but we had to start somewhere. Our initial dataset contains 51 philosophical texts spanning 10 core schools of philosophy.
								<br><br>
								The schools included in the corpus are:
								<div class="row">
									<div class="column">
										<li>Plato</li>
										<li>Aristotle</li>
										<li>Rationalism </li>
										<li>Empiricism</li>
										<li>German Idealism</li>
									</div>
									<div class="column">
										<li>Communism</li>
										<li>Capitalism</li>
										<li>Phenomenology</li>
										<li>Continental Philosophy</li>
										<li>Analytic Philosophy</li>
									</div>
								  </div>
								<br>
								The schools were chosen to give a broad overview of different ideas about the world and to represent more or less the full history of philosophy (nevermind the 1500 years between Aristotle and Descartes, those 
								ages are called dark for a reason). 
								<br><br>
								<h3>Site Features</h3>
								This site has 4 primary features: a <a href='classifier.html'>classifier</a>, a tool for <a href='w2v.html'>word use analysis</a>, <a href='stats.html'>basic stats</a> on each source,
								and a tool for <a href='search.html'>searching the dataset</a>. Since some of these can be difficult to interpret to those not familiar with the techniques of data science, I've provided a 
								page describing how to <a href='interpret.html'>interpret the results</a> of the different site features.
								<br><br>
								Each of these can be used either for business purposes (to classify texts and then research the relevant schools) or just for education or entertainment. I encourage you 
								mess around with them - classify your favorite song lyrics, see how different philosophers think of love, compare who writes the longest sentences. Have fun!
								<br><br>
								<h3>Future Additions</h3>
								While the site as it stands has a lot of useful tools, this project is far from finished. The nd goal is to include a far greater number of texts in the corpus so that the site can 
								be helpful to everyone, not just people interested in the major figures of the western canon. There are also a number of additional data analysis features that are still in the works. 
								Overall, the key future additions fall into two major categories.
								<br><br>
								<b>1. Expanding The Corpus</b><br>
								Under this heading, the following thinkers and schools are top priorities:
								<div class="row">
									<div class="column3">
										<li>Stoicism</li>
										<li>Scholasticism</li>
										<li>Pre-Socratics</li>
									</div>
									<div class="column3">
										<li>Daoism</li>
										<li>Confucianism</li>
										<li>Buddhist texts</li>
									</div>
									<div class='column3'>
										<li>Feminism</li>
										<li>Race Theory</li>
										<li>Gender Studies</li>
									</div>
								</div>
								<br>
								While these the top priorities right now, if you have any suggestions or texts you'd like to contribute, feel free to <a href='mailto:kcalizadeh@gmail.com'>contact me</a> and I'll do our best to get them added.
								<br><br>
								<b>2. Adding Additional Features</b><br>
								I'd also like to add a number of features for public use. One of these would be a web-scraper that could discovery secondary sources. We could then use the tools we've already developed to analyze the secondary literature, both in its own 
								right and in comparison to the primary sources. A second project for future development is a more detailed Twitter interface that could go beyond merely classifying philosophers and could track trends in ideology over time, perhaps within
								certain subgroups of the site. Last and perhaps most simply, it would be great to include date information in the corpus so that word use and word similarity could be tracked over time. This would be an interesting way to analyze the history of philosophy
								and track cultural and conceptual trends.
								<br><br>
								To be honest, these are just the tip of the iceberg, and the potential for developing more and greater tools is enormous. If you'd like to <a href='support.html'>get involved</a>, please don't hesitate to reach out. But for now, stay tuned for more developments and enjoy the site!
